<P2>Gutter cleaning is an essential maintenance task that prevents water damage to your property. Clogged gutters can cause
water to overflow, seep into the foundation, and cause structural damage. Additionally, standing water in gutters can
lead to the growth of mold and attract pests such as mosquitoes and rodents. Routine gutter cleaning can extend the
lifespan of your gutters, prevent costly repairs, and protect your home from water damage. It is recommended to have
your gutters cleaned at least twice a year, in the fall and spring, or more frequently if your house is surrounded by
trees.</P2>
